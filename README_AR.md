# **Overview: Understanding the AutoRegressive (AR) Model**

In this project, I implemented an AutoRegressive (AR) model from scratch using Python's statsmodels library. My goal was to forecast a synthetic time series by leveraging the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations (previous time steps).

## **What is an AR Model?**

An AR model is a type of random process commonly used in time-series analysis. The core idea is simple: the current value depends linearly on its own previous values. It's essentially a linear regression of the data against itself.

Mathematically, an AR model of order $p$, denoted as $AR(p)$, is defined as:

$$X_t = c + \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i X_{t-i} + \epsilon_t$$

Where:

- $X_t$ is the value at time $t$.
- $c$ is a constant (intercept).
- $\phi_i$ are the parameters (coefficients) that the model learns.
- $X_{t-i}$ are the past values (lags).
- $\epsilon_t$ is white noise (randomness).

## **How My Code Works**

1. **Synthetic Data Creation:** I started by generating a linear trend with added Gaussian noise. I chose this approach over a static CSV file so I could verify that the model correctly identifies simple underlying patterns.
2. **Stationarity and ACF:** Before training, I utilized the Autocorrelation Function (ACF).
  - _Why?_ An AR model relies on correlation. If $X_t$ has no relationship with $X_{t-1}$, the model fails. The ACF plot allowed me to visually confirm that past values influence future values.
3. **The Train/Test Split:** I withheld the last 20 data points. It is crucial to test time-series models on "future" data rather than random splits, because the order of data points must be preserved.
4. **Fitting the Model:** I used AutoReg from statsmodels. I set the lags parameter to 15. This effectively tells the model: "To predict what happens tomorrow, look at what happened for the last 15 days."
5. **Visualization:** The final plot (generated by matplotlib) is the most important part of this repo. It overlays the Predicted red line against the Actual green line. This gives me an immediate visual cue on whether the model is overfitting or underfitting the trend.
